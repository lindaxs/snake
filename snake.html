    if wanted to test locally, "link" has to be to where the file exists in your own directory, relative to
    the html file; for example,
    you have directory "snake", cd snake, ls "css js snake.html", the script link would now be script src="js/snake.js" /script
    **excluded angle brackets because forgot how to esc angle brackets to include in comments
  -->
    <canvas id="canvas" width="600" height="600"/>
    <!--
       to link javascript files, the tag used is <script> and </script> to close and src = source to link to jquery, also an absolute path, moved to be after loading canvas
